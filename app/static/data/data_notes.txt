    Jobs/loan and $/job metrics exclude AE
    Avg jobs/loan and Avg $/job exclude loans that did not reported a job count of 0 or did not report a job count 


Improvements to the data:
In cases where the State did not match the Congressional District, addresses and business names were input into Google in an attempt to find the correct state. A complete list of loans that had their state changed can be found here.
